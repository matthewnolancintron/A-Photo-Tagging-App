add functionality for placing a marker on the photo:
If correct, place a marker on the photo in the characterâ€™s locations



To place a marker on the image when the user correctly identifies the character's location, you can use CSS styles or dynamically add a marker element to the DOM. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create a CSS class for the marker styling. This class will define the appearance of the marker, such as its shape, color, and size.

```css
.marker {
  position: absolute;
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: red;
  /* Add any additional styles you want for the marker */
}
```

2. In your component, define a state variable to keep track of the marker's visibility and position. For example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Game = () => {
  const [markerVisible, setMarkerVisible] = useState(false);
  const [markerPosition, setMarkerPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleImageClick = (event) => {
    const { offsetX, offsetY } = event.nativeEvent;
    const characterPosition = { x: offsetX, y: offsetY };

    // Check if the clicked position matches the character's location
    const isCorrectLocation = checkIfCorrectLocation(characterPosition);

    if (isCorrectLocation) {
      // Set the marker's position to the character's location
      setMarkerPosition(characterPosition);
      // Show the marker
      setMarkerVisible(true);
    } else {
      // Display an error message or provide feedback that the selection is incorrect
    }
  };

  const checkIfCorrectLocation = (characterPosition) => {
    // Logic to determine if the character's position matches the clicked position
    // Return true if correct, false otherwise
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Game Image" onClick={handleImageClick} />
      {markerVisible && (
        <div
          className="marker"
          style={{ top: markerPosition.y, left: markerPosition.x }}
        ></div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Game;
```

3. In the `handleImageClick` function, check if the clicked position matches the character's location. If it does, update the marker's position using `setMarkerPosition` and set `markerVisible` to `true` to make the marker visible.

4. In the JSX code, conditionally render the marker element using `{markerVisible && ...}`. Use the `markerPosition` state to set the top and left positions of the marker element dynamically using inline styles.

This way, when the user correctly identifies the character's location by clicking on the image, the marker will be displayed at that position. You can customize the marker's appearance by modifying the CSS class.

Feel free to adapt this example to your specific game logic and styling needs. Let me know if you have any further questions!



























add functionality for saving players score:
Once a round is complete, ask the user for his/her name and record that time. 
similar to an arcade machine.
Create a popup that asks them to enter their name for the high scores table.

update timer to show "score" to inform the player that the time is the score
update timer to display in 00h:00m:00s format right now it's just in seconds

optional add a level select:
Load many images into your database and allow the user to select from them before starting the game.
Current implementation of the game is basically a play all auto progress mode.
if the level select is added turn the current implementation into a play all option.
