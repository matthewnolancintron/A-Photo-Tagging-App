fix marker position it's offest need
to trouble shoot and figure out what's wrong with the 
current implementation

after play testing I noticed the markers were offset 
to left each time could ajdust for this offset


























add functionality for saving players score:
Once a round is complete, ask the user for his/her name and record that time. 
similar to an arcade machine.
Create a popup that asks them to enter their name for the high scores table.

update timer to show "score" to inform the player that the time is the score
update timer to display in 00h:00m:00s format right now it's just in seconds

optional add a level select:
Load many images into your database and allow the user to select from them before starting the game.
Current implementation of the game is basically a play all auto progress mode.
if the level select is added turn the current implementation into a play all option.
