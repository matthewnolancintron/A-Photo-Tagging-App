- once the game is playable and I can start thinking about
users, anonymous users auth stuff and leaderboards

more components will be built later such as possibly a progress bar or score/timer, also things like login area

components to add:
a ui element that is off to the side of the interative image component
that display the user progress based on the items found using the count
to keep it simple 

a fixed login section at the top

more if needed later..


tomorrow:
create the progress display component
and the login comopnent
